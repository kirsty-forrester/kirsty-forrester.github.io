    <h1>Sorry, you have been blocked</h1>

    <div id="default-notice">
        This block may be temporary to due a mistaken automated spam report, in which case it will be removed within 1-3 days. Certain countries have been blocked from accessing this website due to a high percentage of abusive requests. We also sometimes block individual users based on IP address.
    </div>

    <div id="uk-notice">
        <p>If you live in the United Kingdom or Australia, this block is the result of new legislation which leaves us unable to operate in the UK and Australia due to the risk of fines. We are required to comply with a long list of demands, some of which are too expensive or complicated to implement for such a small website so we have been left with no choice but to block users in the UK and Australia.</p>
        <p>We are gutted over having to do this and are deeply sorry to you all. However, social features will soon be shutting down for all users - so you aren't missing out on much!</p>
