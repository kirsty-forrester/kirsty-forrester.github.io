</ul><p>	<strong>What we do with the information we gather</strong><br></p><p>	You are only asked to provide your name and e-mail address if you wish to access the "Adults only" patterns, which feature mature content.

We may occasionally contact you if we have some news to share with you, but you can choose to opt-out of such e-mails at any time. Your IP address is stored to make sure that you are not abusing the services on this site, e.g. repeatedly asking for the same pattern pretending to be different people. We also keep track of your IP so that we can ban you from the site if you act in a manner that is not in accordance with our terms and conditions. We also reserve the right to read your messages at any time to determine if you are acting in a way that is not in accordance with our terms.</p><p id="cke_pastebin">

To the extent applicable, Kandi Patterns complies with applicable laws and regulations, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which governs information gathering online from or about children under the age of 13.

Without this consent, children under the age of 13 are not allowed to join the website.</p><p>Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, in any instance where Kandi Patterns asks for age and determines the user is under the age of 13, Kandi Patterns will require a parent or guardian email address in order to send a <a href="https://kandipatterns.com/files/parental_consent.pdf" target="_blank">consent form</a> to the parent/guardian for verifiable consent before Kandi Patterns collects any personal information from children under the age of 13.</p><p>Without obtaining verifiable parental consent, online contact information collected from a child is only used to respond directly on a one-time basis to a specific request from the child and is not used to re-contact the child and is not maintained in retrievable form by Kandi Patterns.</p><p>In addition to obtaining verifiable consent according to the process described above, Kandi Patterns does NOT:</p><ol><li>collect personally identifiable <em>offline</em> contact information of a child under age 13 without prior parental consent.</li><li>provide any personally identifiable information, regardless of its source, to any third-party for any purpose whatsoever concerning our Users under 13 years of age, unless otherwise disclosed to children and their parents during the information collection process.</li><li>give children under age 13 the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent.</li><li>entice any child by the prospect of a special game, prize, or other activity to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity.</li></ol><p>There are several exceptions that permit collection of a child’s e-mail address without receiving parental consent in advance:</p><ul><li>To provide the parents with notice and to seek consent for communications with the child. Note: this may require collection of the parent’s e-mail address as well.</li><li>To protect the safety of a child who is participating on the site; i.e., in a message board</li><li>To protect the Website or to respond to law enforcement; i.e., in the case of a Website compromise.</li></ul><p>CCPA Privacy Policy</p><p><a href="https://kandipatterns.com/post/view/1512-ccpa-privacy-policy">Click here to view our CCPA privacy policy</a></p><b>Changes to our privacy policy</b><p>Kandipatterns.com keeps its privacy policy under regular review and places any updates on this web page.
